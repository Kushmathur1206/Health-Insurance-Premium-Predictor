# Health-Insurance-Premium-Predictor

For the AI hackthon(24hr), our team created a Health insurance premium predictor. 
It is based on the dataset of insurance amount paid by people of different ages, habits, BMI ,region and various other factors(USA).
The user receives the quotation amount along with the details they filled and the criteria we used to predict the amount in their mail. 
We have used Random Forest Regressor, linear regression model to generate the most accurate results possible.

💡 Use Cases  
- 🏢 Instant Quotation Tool for Insurance Providers
Enable users to get real-time premium estimates without speaking to an agent—automating lead qualification and improving user experience.

- 📊 Lead Segmentation & Risk Profiling
Use the predictor as a backend model to segment potential customers into risk groups and offer tiered plans accordingly.

- 📱 Integration into Health & Wellness Platforms
Add the predictor to fitness apps or wearable dashboards to give users insights into how lifestyle changes could affect their insurance costs.

- 🧑‍⚖️ Transparency for End Users
Helps users understand how factors like smoking, BMI, or age impact premium pricing—building trust through explainability.

- 🧠 Foundation for Dynamic Pricing Models
Extend the model with real-time data (like wearable inputs or updated health records) to simulate personalized, usage-based insurance pricing.
